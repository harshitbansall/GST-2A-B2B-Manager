### Inspiration and Need
My Father owns a business. 
So at the end of every financial quarter he had to compare these both files on pen and paper. 
So I made this Simple Python Script which can alter these both files into one PDF file which is so much easier to compare.

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "Resources/1.png" height = "400">
</p>

### Example
There are 2 Files Named:
* *GSTR - 2A .xlx* :

* <p align = "center">
  <img src = "Resources/2.png" height = "400">
  </p>
* *GSTR - B2B .xlx* :

* <p align = "center">
  <img src = "Resources/3.png" height = "400">
</p>
* After Using The Script. A PDF File is Generated :

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "Resources/4.png" height = "400">
</p>
